    <h1>Red Sauce with Meat</h1>
    <img src="/imgs/MeatSauce.jpg" alt="" height="500px" width="400px">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a simple recipe for a pasta tomato sauce with meat that I have developed over the years. It is very simple and can be a quick and easy dinner to make. You can use whatever kind of meat you want; I prefer to use ground beef and Italian sausage however, anything can work. I have even used chicken in a pinch. If you want a vegetarian option you can forego the meat entirely and add other vegetables such as zucchini!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion (diced)</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>1 pounds ground beef/pork</li>
            <li>1 28oz can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up the oil in a pan on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the oinon and sautee untill soft and translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and salt and pepper to taste. Brown beef all over. Don't worry if it's undercooked we wll finish cooking it in the sauce.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, worcestershire sauce, and red pepper flakes. Stir untill well combined.</li>
            <li>Simmer on low for 10 minutes, stiring occasionally.* Add salt and pepper to taste and serve!</li>
            <li>*If you have time I suggest simmering for 20-30 minutes to help everything meld together.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Serve this on whatever your favorite pasta or noodle is! This can also be cooked ahead of time and frozen for later. It keeps fairly well in the freezer for a month or two. When ready to use it, just place it in the fridge the night before and reheat in a pot.</p>
