    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a simple recipe for a pasta tomato sauce with meat that I have developed over the years. It is very simple and can be a quick and easy dinner to make. You can use whatever kind of meat you want; I prefer to use ground beef and Italian sausage however, anything can work. I have even used chicken in a pinch. If you want a vegetarian option you can forego the meat entirely and add other vegetables such as zucchini!</p>
